# Change Adaption Engineering

## Motivation

It's October 2023 and there are so many engineering roles in the industry. One area in particular
has an identity crisis and that is the role that creates environments and helps developers get
their code there. Is it a Platform Engineer? Is it a DevOps Engineer? SRE? Something else !?

It makes it hard for new engineers in this space to know how to get to the coveted Senior Role, hard
for a Senior to guide new engineers, and a silly amount of hard for anyone involved in recruitment
to get it done !

## So what is Change Adaption Engineering

It is provisioning virtualised infrastructure, like a VM or anything in the cloud. It is being the steward of the infrastructure, feeding and watering it. It is taking that infrastructure, integrating it with other things and turning it into a system of value, like an API. It's adapting the system to change, like giving it more CPU at Christmas or fixing the expired certificate. It's helping developers get their code to production.

In this brave new world we embrace the principles of DevOps, SRE, Agile etc etc. We are the courier of change and the engineers of resilience.
