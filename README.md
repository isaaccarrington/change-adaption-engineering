# Change Adaption Engineering

## Motivation

It's October 2023 and there are so many engineering roles in the industry. One area in particular
has an identity crisis and that is the role that creates environments and helps developers get
their code there. Is it a Platform Engineer? Is it a DevOps Engineer? SRE? Something else !?

It makes it hard for new engineers in this space to know how to get to the coveted Senior Role, hard
for a Senior to guide new engineers, and a silly amount of hard for anyone involved in recruitment
to get it done !
